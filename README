BUILDING:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sarasvati uses ant to build. To rebuild the library .jar file, run

 > ant dist

 The .jar file will be generated in dist/sarasvati-<version>/.

 NOTE: If you downloaded the "slim" version of sarasvati, the 3rd party libraries used by sarasvati
       won't be distributed with it, to save space. When a dist build is done, they will be fetched
       from the SVN repository. If you wish to fetch them without doing a full build, run

> ant fetchlibs

USAGE:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
XML Process definitions should conform to the XML Schema in common/workflow.xsd. External elements
may be embedded. See some of the example workflows and common/example.xsd.

If using the Hibernate backend, the database schema must be created. The schema creation script
has only been tested on PostgreSQL, but may work with other databases. The Hibernate backend
should work with any database supported by Hibernate which supports identity columns. It has only
been tested with PostgreSQL though.

EXAMPLES:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some example workflows can be found in common/test-wf

Some test programs can be found in in examples/
