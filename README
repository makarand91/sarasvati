BUILDING:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sarasvati uses ant to build. To rebuild the library .jar file, run

 > ant dist

 The .jar file will be generated in dist/sarasvati-<version>/.

 NOTE: The 3rd party libraries used by sarasvati are not distributed with it, to save space. When a
       dist build is done, they will be fetched from the SVN repository. If you wish to fetch them
       without doing a full build, run

> ant fetchlibs

USAGE:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
XML Process defintions should conform to the XML Schema in common/workflow.xsd. External elements
may be embedded. See some of the example workflows and common/example.xsd.

If using the Hibernate backend, the database schema must be created. The schema creation script
has only been tested on PostgreSQL, but may work with other databases. The Hibernate backend
should work with any database supported by Hibernate which supports identity columns. It has only
been tested with PostgreSQL though.

EXAMPLES:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some example workflows can be found in common/test-wf
