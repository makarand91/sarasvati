Node: Node in Directed Graph
  inputs: List of nodes. Each node in the list has this node as an output.
  outputs: List of nodes. Each node in the list has this node as an input.

Token: Represents the current state of execution
  node: The node that this token is at
  prev: The node that the token came from


Node Types

Fork:
  Generates a token at every output.

Join:
  If there are tokens from every input, generates a token at its output

Notes on subworkflows:
  1. A node can have an input from or output to an external workflow.
  2. It will be referenced by some identifier and a version.
  3. 2 nodes could refer to the same workflow
    a. They may refer to the same instance or a separate instance
    b. Thus they must also identify which instance they are connected to
  4. If there is more than 1 instance of an external workflow, the nodes
     must be copied or wrapped with nodes with new ids. This is because
     we will have distinct nodearcs for them and because nodearcs are
     looked up by node id, we need distinct nodes.
