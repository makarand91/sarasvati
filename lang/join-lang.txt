Design Notes:

What are the kinds of things we'd like to be able to say?

Statements:

  STMT = REQUIRE 
       | REQUIRE "or" STMT
       | REQUIRE "and" STMT
       | "(" STMT ")"
       | "if" EXPR "then" STMT "else" STMT

  REQUIRE = "require" node <node name>
          | "require any" <arc name>
          | "require at least" <number>
          | "require at least" <number> <arcname>
          | "require node" <node name>
          | "require tokenset" <token set name>

  EXPR = <predicate>
       |
